## Adaptive Cruise Control
# The main objective is to control car speed automatically by using Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic Sensor, and Motor Drive. We have programmed the Arduino UNO in C.
# I have worked in a team to design and develop an Android application to control the car's ACC system. We used Java to build the app.

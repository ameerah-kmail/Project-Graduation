\begin{center}\textbf{ABSTRACT}\end{center}

Increasing in the population of humans among the world increases the demand of more cars and other transportation means. In our county, there is increasing in the number of cars without increasing the infrastructure of roads, which increases the number of car accidents. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are helpful systems that assist drivers in control cars and warn them to avoid many troubles while driving and parking. ADAS consists of several systems. In this project, we introduce the Adaptive Cruise Control System (ACC) that will be implemented though a prototype car controlled with Arduino microcontroller and mobile application.
A mobile application will be developed to control the car movement as manual driving and to activate the ACC system and set the limit speed. The microcontroller will receive the instruction from the mobile application to control the car.  When ACC system is activated and the limit speed is set then the car will keep the speed within the limit. In this mode, the speed of the car will be adjusted to maintain safe distance with the leading car without exceeding the limit (previously set) speed of ACC. The car will stop when the leading car is stop or when there is an obstacle in its path.

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Problem Statement and Purpose}}
With the increase in the world population, the need for cars has increased and they are used more frequently and daily. This leads to traffic congestion, rushing, collisions and accidents that may cause loss of life and property. The causes of accidents are endless, but violating traffic and speed laws is one of the main causes of them, which requires the presence of an integrated system that addresses these causes. Indeed, the Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) system controls the car and alerts the driver to avoid these problems, through visual and audio cues generated in response to a vehicle's distance, speed, position, direction and surroundings. It is a main system containing sub-systems, each of which addresses a cause of traffic accidents. The Adaptive Cruise Control(ACC) is one of the main subsystems that we will develop in this project. The system helps vehicles to maintain a safe tracking distance and stay within the speed limits.This system automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed in proportion to the vehicle in front of it. Vehicles equipped with this technology will maintain sufficient distance between them and other vehicles. These space-conscious features will also help prevent accidents caused by obstructed vision or close tracking distance. The ACC will also help in regulating the traffic.

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Project and Design Objectives}}
In our project, our main objective is to implement an Adaptive Cruise Control System (ACC) to control car speed automatically. The overall system is controlled by a custom-made app. The application  provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a user-friendly real-time experience. The GUI shows buttons to turn the car on (or off) and set the speed limit, and controls the car's movement in different directions, like left, right, forward, and backward. In addition, it shows buttons to turn the ACC on (or off) to give the driver the choice between manual driving or having the additional features of the ACC.

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Intended Outcomes and Deliverable}}
In this project, we will build a vehicle equipped with adaptive control system. We also will create an application controls  the movement of the car in different directions. 

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Summary of Report Structure}}
In this chapter, we discussed the importance, the problem statement and purpose and the intended outcomes and deliverable of our project. In Chapter 2 we will present overview of the system and also, we will explain the related work. In chapter 3 we will present the design of the project, the components used, and the methods and methodologies on which the project depends. In chapter 4, we will discuss the results we reached in our project. In chapter 5, we will mention the costs, effort and time required for the project. In chapter 6, we will mention the effect of engineering solution of our project on many areas. In chapter 7, we will present the conclusions and future plans and recommendations of our project.

\chapter{BACKGROUND} 
\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Overview}}

Currently, with the great development of the automobile industry, there are millions of vehicles on the roads around the world and this makes our lives easier, but this causes a certain amount of risk, according to the World Health Organization, the lives of nearly 1.3 million people die every year as a result of road accidents \cite{injuries} .Therefore , car manufacturers and engineers are working hard to produce cars with a higher level of safety, performance and efficiency.

So, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are the most important electronic technologies that help drivers control driving and parking, and the ACC is one of the most popular ADAS applications.  There are some projects that are similar to our project, and there are a number of car companies working on modernizing their cars and developing a ACC system for them.

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Related Work}}
Increasing global demand for enhanced driver safety, comfort, and convenience requires adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in cars. Understanding this evolution provides insight for researchers. Therefore, we point to some projects to show their recent stages of development in ACC.

\subsection{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Fully Automated Cruise Control System Using Ultrasonic Sensor}}
This system presented an approach that avoided accidents happening on highways. The system develops a prototype model using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. When an obstacle is detected by a long-range sensor, it detects an obstacle up to 20 meters in front. Then the speed of the vehicle is slowed down automatically according to the gap. In addition, the system provides an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) to display the status messages to the driver, such as system ON, vehicle detected, vehicle stopped, speed of the vehicle, etc.
\\\\
This design considered only the distance of the vehicle in multiple lanes. When the ultrasonic sensor detects a vehicle in front and in the same lane as it, the speed initially decreases and the sensors on the adjacent sides are engaged to check the adjacent lanes for any traffic movement. If the adjacent lane is empty, the system automatically directs the vehicle to the adjacent lane without losing stability and accelerates the car to the preset speed. After passing, it once again directs the car back to the previously occupied lane. The system controls the speed of the vehicle automatically through pulse width modulation\cite{Automated}.

\subsection{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Remote and Autonomous Controlled Robotic Carbased on Arduino with Real Time Obstacle Detection and Avoidance}}
In this system, they design and implement a robotic car regarding hardware, software, and communication environments and detect in real time an obstacle to avoid it. In the implementation of the system, it consists of an Arduino UNO, an HC-06 Bluetooth module, an Arduino motor shield, a DC motor, an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04, a PIR sensor, a buzzer, a 9V battery, and an Android application. The robotic car consists of two modes: user control and automatic mode. The user can control the robot's basic movements back and forth, right-left rotation, and stop-motion, or put the robotic car in automatic mode to let the car drive its own way, so it can flee from an obstacle and also detect live objects.
\\

    \caption{Ultrasonic Sensor working principle \cite{Robotic}.}
    \label{fig:Ultrasonic Sensor working principle}
    
\end{figure}
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to calculate the distance between the robotic car and the obstacle. It measures between 2 and 400 cm. In Figure (\ref{fig:Ultrasonic Sensor working principle}), it shows the ultrasonic sensor's working principle. If the obstacle is a human, the red LED and buzzer sound will activate. It calculates the shortest distance that can be avoided. If the obstacle is an inanimate entity, it calculates the shortest distance that can be avoided. Furthermore, when the robot reaches the cliff, it perceives the abyss and stops itself\cite{Robotic}. 
\\
\subsection{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Vision-Based Adaptive Cruise Control Using Pattern Matching}}

This system uses image processing algorithms to detect vehicles and determine range using a single camera. This is done by detecting the fiducial marker which is one of the general signs of cars such as (number plate, rear windshield or tail lights) and when detecting the size and direction the fiducial marker is used to calculate the geometric range.
It works by matching patterns by searching an image for a predefined template It uses normalize cross-correlation to find a template in an image. The underlying algorithm for detecting a vehicle's progress involves the set of a template of the target vehicle with different scales and orientations under different environmental conditions\cite{PatternMatching}.

    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Analysis of Existing Systems}}
 
 The fundamental issue in the first study is that the ACC is unaware of other cars' movements. The drivers must maintain constant awareness. The expense of designing ACC systems nowadays is one of the most difficult difficulties. The ACC does not drive your automobile for you, and it cannot be utilized in crowded places. Because the object is more than three meters away and has a reflective surface at a shallow angle, the sound will be too small to reflex back to the sensor.
 
 In the second study, they operate the vehicle using components similar to ours and an application. The contrast is that they just identify the obstruction. If an impediment is in front of the automobile, they do nothing to slow it down or speed it up. As a result, we have an edge.

Finally, in the third study, it is difficult in practice to identify a generic fiducial marker that can be accurately detected at medium-to-long distances (more than 30 meters). For example, number plates often come in different shapes and are too small to be accurate. identified and measured by a camera with reasonable resolution.

The components were not readily available in our city, and obtaining them required some effort. The Bluetooth connection model's maximum range is 9 meters, so the capacity to manage the automobile is limited. External circumstances caused the hardware parts to fail, requiring us to purchase the parts (Arduino, drivers) again, increasing the project cost. Because it is costly to cover all of the pieces required to achieve all of the functions in ADAS, we have picked one of these features.


\subsection{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Standards:}}
The most important standards used in the components used in our project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item HC-06 Bluetooth Module: IEEE 802.15.1 standardized protocol.  
  \item Arduino Uno:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item UART:universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter, is one of the most used
   device-to-device communication protocols . 
  \item I2C:stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit, it is a bus interface connection
   protocol incorporated into devices for serial communication specially designed
    for microcontrollers.
  \item SPI:stands for Serial Peripheral Interface, is an interface bus commonly
   used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripherals. 
\end{itemize}
  
  \item lithium-ion battery: ISO 26262 safety standard for lithium-ion battery. 
\end{itemize}


\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Design Alternatives}}
In the alternatives section, we presented three designs that evolved from the first concepts to the final product. We'll try to explain why the other designs failed and how we came up with this solution in this part.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first design, which had our basic first idea, the use of distance sensors, was key to this system in that we are going to construct our controlling unit to control the complete system by employing Ultrasonic Range Finder-LV-MaxSonar-EZ1. This design had a number of flaws, including that there were better options depending on the price. We saved money by using the Ultrasonic Sensor Module HC-SR-04 instead of the Ultrasonic Range Finder-LV-MaxSonar-EZ1.

 \item The second design, we tried to use flutter for the android application, but we opted to stick with Java since we were familiar with it and because flutter documentation and resources were not as widely available online as Java. As a result, if we face any problems, an unusual bug, or an issue in our application, it may be more difficult to fix than with Java.

 \item In the thired design, there are two types of microcontrollers to employ that the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. However, we chose the Arduino Uno since it is low-power, less expensive than the Raspberry Pi, and the digital and analog ports provide a wide range of communication, so the vast number of I/O pins allows you to connect various sensors and components.
 
  \item In the fourth design, while there are numerous different connection technologies today, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are the two most widely used. Compared to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth devices use less electricity. The Bluetooth model was created with minimal energy usage in mind. And Bluetooth gadgets are typically less expensive. We chose the Bluetooth HC-06.
\end{itemize}

The final design corrects the flaws in the earlier designs. to complete the task and meet our expectations in terms of cost and timeliness.

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Simulation and/or Experimental Test}}
In the simulation, we used tools like  tinkercad and Proteus to understand and illustrate connections and to simulate components and understand how each works separately.
\subsection{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Test Ultrasonic sensor using the  tinkercad simulator.}}
Figure (\ref{fig:Distance}) shows a simulation (using a tinkercad simulator) that we ran on the ultrasonic sensor to make sure that the connections were correct and that the equation used to find the distance is correct.

The formula \textbf{distance = speed*time} is used to calculate the distance. But because the time from the sensor represents the time taken from the wave to travel and then echo back, so we divide the distance by 2, and the equation become:
\textbf{distance =(speed*time)/2} 
and the waves move with sound speed, which is 340m/s, equivalent to 0.034cm/Âµs 
so, the equation become:\\
\textbf{distance=(0.034cm/Âµs*time) }also equivalent to \textbf{distance= pulse / 29.387 / 2}\\
which we use in our code where pulse represent the time from echo Pin.

\chapter{RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS}
\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Results}}
In this chapter, we'll discuss the outcomes of our system's implementation.

The application starts with the main page that has a Bluetooth address and two buttons, as well as a Bluetooth address that displays the address of another Bluetooth device. The first button is MANUAL, which takes you to the manual driving page, and the second is the ADAS button, which takes you to the ADAS page.

    \graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,height=.5\textheight ]{main.jpg}
    \caption{The main page}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}
On manual driving page, the user can manually drive the car in four directions (FORWARD, REVERSE, LEFT, RIGTE), as well as STOP, and can return to the main page by pressing the BACK TO MAIN button.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,height=.5\textheight ]{manual.jpg}
    \caption{The  manual driving page}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}
There are four buttons on the ADAS page. As indicated in the figure, each of these buttons takes you to a distinct system page (ACC system page, ESC system page, FCW system page, LDW system page). The ACC system is implemented in our application, therefore pressing the ACC system button takes the user to the ACC system page, and pressing the BACK TO MAIN button returns the user to the main page.

    \graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,height=.5\textheight ]{adas.jpg}
    \caption{ The ADAS page}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}
On the ACC system page, the user can enter the initial speed that the car should move at when the ACC system is active. The user presses the SEND button, then the START button to start the ACC system. The user can stop the system by pressing the STOP button.  and the user can press the BACK TO MAIN button to return to the main page or the BACK TO ADAS button to return to the ADAS page.

    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth,height=.5\textheight ]{acc.jpg}
    \caption{ The ACC page}
    \label{fig:mesh1}
\end{figure}
In our system, if the user selects the manual drive, the wheels move in the same direction as the user selects in the application, and if the user selects the ACC system, the car will move at the initial speed that the user specific in the application. Then the ultrasonic measures the front distance (D). if the D$>=$ D1 cm the car keeps moving in the initial speed. else if   DS$<$D$<$D1 cm the speed will be gradually decreased. If the D$<$ DS itâs the stop distance, so the car will stop.

\end{figure}

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Discussions}}
 Our project meets the main goal of implementing the ACC system to regulate the speed based on the measurement of front distance, so the speed will be reduced to keep the distance between the cars safe, and the user can manage the car using the application. based on the results in the previous section.
However, because we use the Bluetooth module and the wifi is costly, and 3G and 4G networks are not available in Palestine, there is some latency while transmitting commands via the application.

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Lessons Learned}}
From working on the senior project, we've learned some constructive practices, such as working as a team, sharing tasks evenly, and cooperating to solve any problems that arise. One of the most critical aspects of a project's success is its advance preparation. Studying prior projects and learning from their mistakes in order to work on solving similar problems that may arise in our project and correctly managing it. Calculate the amount of time needed to complete the job and stick to the deadlines.
However, there were some drawbacks to working on the graduation project, such as the fact that not all of the components were available in our city, requiring a lot of effort; the hardware parts were affected by external factors, necessitating the purchase of some components again; and there were some problems and errors during programming that took a long time to resolve.

\chapter{IMPACT OF THE ENGINEERING SOLUTION}
\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Economical, Societal and Global}}
The increasing number of accidents is one of the major drivers responsible for the growth of adaptive cruise control systems. So, there has been a continuous demand for increasing safety features to be installed during the manufacturing of vehicles. The ACC system will reduce the number of accidental deaths and injuries. An adaptive cruise control system will help to control the speed of vehicles and maintain a safe distance between two vehicles. 
The increase in demand for adaptive cruise control systems in the global market is because of the rising number of accidents due to an increase in traffic. Another reason is increasing incomes and greater sales of luxury cars. And increasing using sensors with the another technology.
It also saves you money by increasing your gas mileage and thus minimizing your vehicle's fuel consumption.Also Because it's easier to keep inside the speed limit, there are fewer speeding tickets.


\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Environmental and Ethical}}
The usefulness of a system is directly proportional to its use in the correct recommended manner. The system should be used in straight or fast ways and avoided on slopes. Using the system does not mean that the driver is not responsible for driving, there are situations that require quick intervention from the driver.
The goal of the system, if used in the correct way, is to reduce driver fatigue over long distances and reduce traffic accidents resulting from collision between cars or a car hitting a fixed barrier, run-over accidents, as well as contribute to the regulation of traffic.
The system contributes to saving lives and enhancing safety while driving. Thus, it can be said that the project has a positive ethical and environmental impact.

\chapter{CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS}

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Summary of Achievements of the Project Objectives}}
The main objective of our project to design a system that helps reduce traffic accidents. Indeed, after continuous and intense work for a period of time, we were able to achieve the desired goal. The system is designed and built according to the planned requirements. A mobile application is created to control the vehicle's motion and the ACC system through commands that are sent to the control unit via the Bluetooth module. Despite the challenges we faced, such as the lack of required components and a defect in the internal installation of some components, we were able to complete the project at the lowest possible cost and on time. This was a very useful experience for us we learned to work within one team to reach our common goal on time.

\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{New Skills and Experiences Learnt}}
This experience and project provided us with a wealth of knowledge and skills that will serve us well in the future, particularly in our profession. For example, we learned new skills like latex, Android development, and Arduino, which we used to create the Android application that control the overall system. We also improved our knowledge of the Java programming language, which we used to create the Android application. We also learned how to connect the hardware and link it to the software (application).


\section{\fontsize{12}{12}\selectfont{Recommendations for Future Work}}
We will discuss some of the future features that can be added to the system. These features will improve system functionality. The ability to connect via 3G and 4G networks could be added to the system in the future. Furthermore, the ACC's behavior improved on non-straight roads, particularly roundabouts, up and down hills, and in windy conditions. integrating ACC with other ADAS assistance systems, such as automatic parking, which assists in moving the vehicle from a traffic lane to a parking space, and a car navigation system, which assists in finding direction in an automobile.
